In the first millennium CE there were in Chinese Turkestan
two closely related languages, Tocharian A and Tocharian B,
which had descended from a common ancestor, Proto-Tocharian.
Here are some Proto-Tocharian words

When describing how personal and reflexive pronouns work in various languages,
linguists make use of the so-called subscripts---Roman letters
(typically $i$, $j$, $k$, \dots)\ which mark pronouns and some other words
in sentences. The character $*$ (asterisk) is also used.
Here are some English examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item John$_i$ saw himself$_i$ in the mirror.
\item John$_i$ says that he$_{i/j/{}^*k}$ doesn't know Peter$_k$.
\item The boy$_i$ is playing with his$_{i/j}$ gun.
\item His$_i$ teacher$_j$'s influence in easily seen in his$_{i/{}^*j/k}$ work.
\item The girl$_i$ saw her$_{{}^*i/j}$.
\end{enumerate}

\assignment Explain the meaning of the subscripts and the asterisk.

\assignment Add subscripts (and asterisks where appropriate)
in the following sentences:

\begin{items}
\item She doesn't like this trait in herself.
\item The father took his son to his room.
\item John knows that Peter has given his book to his son.

All Arabic words in the problem are made according to one of the patterns
\wipa{1a2a3t}, \wipa{i12\A3}, \wipa{1u23} and \wipa{1u23\E n}
(whereby words using the first and the second pattern always come together in this order
and words using the other two patterns occur on their own).
In these patterns \wipa{1-2-3} is one of the triples of consonants
\wipa{r-b-C}, \wipa{s-b-C}, \wipa{s-d-s}, \wipa{t-l-t},
\wipa{t-m-n}, \wipa{t-s-C}, \wipa{x-m-s}, \wipa{C-\sh-r}.
Let us assume that the consonant triples correspond to numbers between $1$ and $10$
and the arrangements of the vowels indicate certain functions, in particular,
\wipa{1a2a3t} \wipa{i1$'$2$'$\A3$'$} is either $\frac n{n'}$ or $\frac {n'}n$
(and in either case $\egar{xamast ixm\A s}=\frac nn=1$),
and $\egar{1u23} = \frac in$ and $\egar{1u23\E n} = \frac jn$,
for some as yet unknown $i$ and $j$.

From equality (5) we see that \wipa{s-b-C} and \wipa{x-m-s} are $5$ and $7$
(in one order or the other), and from $\frac j5+\frac j7=\frac{(7+5)j}{35}=\frac{24}{35}$
it follows that $j=2$, that is, $\egar{1u23\E n} = \frac 2n$.
Since \wipa{1u23} is shorter than \wipa{1u23\E n}, we can assume
that this pattern corresponds to a more basic function, and the only candidate for such a one is $\frac 1n$.

From (1) it follows that \wipa{t-l-t} is $3$
(and that the numerator precedes the denominator in the Arabic fractions).
From (4) we see that \wipa{t-m-n} is greater than \wipa{s-b-C} by one.
From (3) it follows that $3\egar{s-d-s} = 2\egar{t-s-C}$.
Thus \wipa{t-s-C} is divisible by three. Since the value $3$ is already taken,
\wipa{t-s-C} and \egar{s-d-s} are either $6$ and $4$ or $9$ and~$6$, respectively,
and \wipa{t-m-n}, \wipa{s-b-C} and \wipa{x-m-s} are respectively $8$, $7$ and $5$.

We have yet to use equality (2).
Letting \wipa{s-d-s} be equal to $4$ gets us nowhere
($\frac73 + \frac14 = \frac{31}{12}$ can't be reduced to a fraction
with a numerator and denominator between $1$ and $10$),
consequently $\egar{s-d-s}=6$,
and $\frac73 + \frac16 = \frac{15}6 = \frac52 = \frac{10}4 = \egar{C-\sh-r}/\egar{r-b-C}$.
(The root \wipa{r-b-C} `$4$' is the source of the word \word{ruba'i} `quatrain',
used also in English.)

$\egar{rubC} + \egar{Ca{\sh}art its\A C} = \frac14 + \frac{10}9 = \frac{49}{36}$
and $\egar{sabaCt isd\A s} = \frac76$.
Thus either $\sqrt{\egar{rubC} + \egar{Ca{\sh}art its\A C}} = \egar{sabaCt isd\A s}$
or, perhaps, $\egar{rubC} + \egar{Ca{\sh}art its\A C} = (\egar{sabaCt isd\A s})^2$
(if we don't consider brackets to be a sign).

There are two types of English expressions in the problem:
some (I) consist of a date, a month and a day of the week,
others (II) name the number of the day of the week within the month instead of the date.
The word order in the Basque expressions of type (I) is \<month> \<date>, \<day of the week>,
whilst in type (II) it is \<month> \<number of the day> \<day of the week>.
The last word ends in \word{-a},
whereas the preceding words have no final \word{-a}
(except for the word \word{hogeita}, which means `20' in compound numerals).
The element \word{-garren} forms ordinal numbers.
The word \word{astea} is not a name of a day of the week
(six of those we have seen in examples 1--10, the seventh occurs in Assignment~3).
Since Assignment 2 features the word `week', we can guess
that this is the meaning of the word \word{astea}.

\word{Astelehena} means literally `first (day) of the week',

Tuesday's Basque name can be translated more or less
as `day in the middle of the week'.

The table features verbs with two different prefixes: \word{re-} and \word{r\'e-}.
All verbs with \word{re-} indicate a repetition
or a renewal of the action named by the verb without a prefix.
Contrariwise, if the prefix is \word{r\'e-},
then the corresponding prefixless verb either doesn't exist
or means the same thing as the prefixed one does.
The verbs whose stems begin with vowels are an exception:
the prefix they take is \word{r\'e-}
regardless of the existence and the meaning of a corresponding prefixless verb.
There are other exceptions from this rule in French,
but on the whole it is fairly reliable.

\comment
The vowel in the prefix \word{r\'e-} is not unlike the first vowel in \word{raider},
whereas the one in the prefix \word{re-} bears a certain similarity to the second,
and needs to be fortified when it finds itself next to another vowel.

The first pair gives the correspondence \wipa{\d st}---\wipa{st}.
This determines unambiguously the second pair (or triple, rather), whence we learn
that Tocharian B has kept the final vowels (except for the `specific' one) and Tocharian A has lost them.
Consequently all words  with retained final vowels are Tocharian B
and their counterparts with lost final vowels are Tocharian A.
This allows the following conclusions to be made:
In Tocharian A the `specific' vowel falls out before a vowel that is retained
and is retained before one that is lost;
\wipa a, long or short, is preserved without change.
In Tocharian B the `specific' vowel can become \wipa a, \wipa{\schwa} or nothing
and both {\wipa a\/}s can become either \wipa a or \wipa{\A}.
This determines the remaining pairs.

Identical letters mean identical individuals, different letters mean different individuals.
In this way it is shown which pronoun can refer to which noun.
If a pronoun can refer to more than one noun,
all possible subscripts are given, separated by slashes.
If a pronoun can refer to an individual not mentioned in the sentence,
a letter is used that doesn't mark any other word in the same sentence
(e.~g., \word{he} in (2) may be someone other than John or Peter, let's say Bill, if he exists at all).
An asterisk next to a letter indicates

The left column contains what are technically known as performative verbs.
(The concept of performativity was introduced in 1965 by the English philosopher John Austin.) 
They are different from other verbs in that
the action they name can be performed by their use, rather than simply described.
So the words \word{`I accuse you of murder'}
all by themselves constitute an accusation;
the words \word{`I denounce you as an impostor'}, a denunciation;
\word{`I command you to report to the headquarters at once'}, a command;
\word{`I advise you not to go there'}, advice;
\word{`I assure you that this problem is not so hard'}, assurance.
Performativity is a rather peculiar property;
